<h1> How to construct a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich.</h1>
<body>
Penut butter and Jelly sandwiches have been the main source of food for humans for thousands of years. There are many variations of it, with different toppings and jellys. Today I am going to show you how to construct a standard Peanut butter and Grape Jelly sandwich.

  <h2>Supplies:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>butter knife</li>
<li>spoon</li>
<li>Peanut Butter</li>
<li>Jelly</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Step 1:</h2> Bread

Place your two slices of bread opposite eachother on a plate.

<h2>Step 2:</h2>Peanut Butter

Use your butter knife to scoop out a generous portion of peanut butter. The brand of peanut butter that you use is your decisions (i prefer Peter Pan Peanut Butter). Once you have the peanut on your knife, begin to spread it over the bread.
